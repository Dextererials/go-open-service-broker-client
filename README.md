# go-open-service-broker-client

A golang client for service brokers implementing the
[Open Service Broker API](https://github.com/openservicebrokerapi/servicebroker).

## Current status

This repository is a pet project of mine.  During the day, I work on the
[Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes)
[Service Catalog](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/service-catalog) as well as
the Open Service Broker API specification.  My goal is for this repo to
contain a great golang client for the API, as well as a fake that facilitates
unit-style testing.

I'm currently just sketching around in my free time, but would love to
eventually donate this repo to an organization if people decide that it is
useful.
